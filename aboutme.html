                    To the kind soul reading this, Hi I am Ketan hailing from ECE branch.
                    I come from a unknown town called Satna from the most forgetfull state Madhya Pradesh. For me, Even guwahati seems like a big city :). I am interested in a lot of stuff as you will know as you go along reading this site. But yeah this is a really fun making my first ever website, I am super hyped.   
                </p>
                <p class="pright">
                    To be honest I am not that extroverted. Too shy to upload my pics. Sometimes I just like to stay alone and enjoy my own company but who doesnt these days. The college experience is extremely overwhelming for me atleast. New day new deadlines old me :)).

            Even though i am bit on the shy side. I still absolutely love Public speaking. I guess its my way to express myself on a bigger stage. I actively take part in debates and really enjoy hosting events. Recently I hosted the GHM and I was the opening host of MUN in alcher this year.

                I haven't really achieved much in life yet atleast. But here is one of my favourite thing about myself, I made a all working prototype based on aurdino to help farmers. It was funded by ATL lab which is a central government initiative to promote tinkering among young kids. This project is from back when i was in my 9th standard. It was a really fun experience. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=837uleHT_7U&t=162s&ab_channel=AtalTinkeringLabChristukula">Click here </a> to checkout the youtube video it's pretty cool stuff.

                I guess you can say i am out of content at this point. But anyways  I have had a good ranks in SOF Olympiads which nobody cares about. I was ranked internationally 18 in cyber Olympiad and 3rd in country. It really was fun for me maybe not that competetive but definitely fun.
